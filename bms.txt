1.State of Charge (SOC) - Ratio b/w present charge and full charge capacity
It helps to analyze how much charge is available in the battery

2.State of Power (SOP) - Ratio b/w peak power to nominal power
It decides the power transfer capacity of battery.
Analyzes when the voltage is less and also analyze the driver how much acceleration battery can withstand

3.State of Health (SOH)
Ratio b/w present full charge capacity and original full charge capacity
Frequent charging and discharging affect the battery life
Analyzes when the battery can be replaced

BMS (Battery Mgmt System)
----------------------------
Issues without BMS - Safety (due to temp fluctuations, catches fire)
					 Over Charging alarm
					 Electric shock
					 
Needs - Cooling system
	    Continuous Temp Measurement
		Safe mode activation


the battery management system (BMS), an embedded controller that regulates the flow and distribution of power to and from the cells.
